A common technique used in molecular generative modeling is to use SMILES strings with recurrent neural networks built into variational autoencoders - but these suffer from a myriad of issues: vanishing gradients, long-range forgetting, and invalid molecules. In this work, we show that by combining recurrent neural networks with convolutional networks in a hierarchical manner, we are able to both extract autoregressive information from SMILES strings while maintaining signal and long-range dependencies. This allows for generations with very high validity rates on the order of 95% when reconstructing known molecules.

Such an ascertained tree typically represents only a small part of a comprehensive population tree and is distorted by survivorship and sampling biases. Inferring evolutionary parameters from ascertained trees requires modeling both the underlying population dynamics and the ascertainment process. A crucial component of this phylodynamic modeling involves tree simulation, which is used to benchmark probabilistic inference methods. To simulate an ascertained tree, one must first simulate the full population tree and then prune unobserved lineages. Consequently, the computational cost is determined not by the size of the final simulated tree, but by the size of the population tree in which it is embedded. In most biological scenarios, simulations of the entire population are prohibitively expensive due to computational demands placed on lineages without sampled descendants. Here, we address this challenge by proving that, for any partially ascertained process from a general multi-type birth-death-mutation-sampling (BDMS) model, there exists an equivalent pure birth process (i.e., no death) with mutation and complete sampling. The final trees generated under these processes have exactly the same distribution. Leveraging this property, we propose a highly efficient algorithm for simulating trees under a general BDMS model. Our algorithm scales linearly with the size of the final simulated tree and is independent of the population size, enabling simulations from extremely large populations beyond the reach of current methods but essential for various biological applications. We anticipate that this unprecedented speedup will significantly advance the development of novel inference methods that require extensive training data.",

This study investigates the neural correlates of interacting with intentional versus artificial agents in a simulated tennis game scenario. Employing functional near-infrared imaging spectroscopy (fNIRS), we analyzed brain activity in 50 male participants during gameplay against both types of opponents. Our methodological approach ensures ecological validity by simulating real-world decision-making scenarios while participants undergo fNIRS scanning, avoiding the constraints of traditional neuroimaging methods. We focus on six prefrontal cortex channels, leveraging the 10-20 system, to capture nuanced differences in brain activity. Utilizing wavelet analysis, we dissected the data into frequency-specific differences, revealing subtle variations across different channels and frequency bands. Moreover, we quantified activity by comparing average data signals between rest and play modes across all points. Our findings unveil significant differences in neural activation patterns, particularly in one specific channel and frequency range, suggesting distinct cognitive processing when interacting with intentional agents. These results align with previous neuroimaging studies and contribute to understanding the neural underpinnings of human-agent interactions in naturalistic settings.

The concept of broadly pre-training neural networks has advanced fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and protein engineering. However, similar approaches for small organic molecules have not achieved comparable success. In this work, we introduce a novel pre-training strategy, substrate scope contrastive learning, which learns atomic representations tailored to chemical reactivity. This method considers the grouping of substrates and their yields in published substrate scope tables as a measure of their similarity or dissimilarity in terms of chemical reactivity. We focus on 20,798 aryl halides in the CAS Content Collection spanning thousands of publications to learn a representation of aryl halide reactivity. We validate our pre-training approach through both intuitive visualizations and comparisons to traditional reactivity descriptors and physical organic chemistry principles. The versatility of these embeddings is further evidenced in their application to yield prediction, regioselectivity prediction, and the diverse selection of new substrates. This work not only presents a chemistry-tailored neural network pre-training strategy to learn reactivity-aligned atomic representations, but also marks a first-of-its-kind approach to benefit from the human bias in substrate scope design.",

A two-cell RNN trained with this loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in O-GlcNAcylation site prediction with an F$_1$ score of 38.82% and an MCC of 38.21% on that large dataset."

In this work, we propose TaxDiff, a taxonomic-guided diffusion model for controllable protein sequence generation that combines biological species information with the generative capabilities of diffusion models to generate structurally stable proteins within the sequence space. Specifically, taxonomic control information is inserted into each layer of the transformer block to achieve fine-grained control. The combination of global and local attention ensures the sequence consistency and structural foldability of taxonomic-specific proteins. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TaxDiff can consistently achieve better performance on multiple protein sequence generation benchmarks in both taxonomic-guided controllable generation and unconditional generation.

A positive feedback between the asymmetry of the acto-myosin cortex density and cell motion gives rise to a spontaneous symmetry breaking beyond a threshold contractility that depends on the resistance of extracellular medium. In highly viscous environments, we predict bistability under moderate contractility, so that symmetry breaking needs to be activated. In a viscoelastic environment, we find periodic oscillations in cortex density and velocity polarization. At the boundary between viscous and viscoelastic environments, the cell may either cross into the viscoelastic medium, bounce back into the viscous medium, or become trapped at the boundary. The different scenarios defined different phase diagram that are confirmed by numerical simulations.",

A positive feedback between the asymmetry of the acto-myosin cortex density and cell motion gives rise to a spontaneous symmetry breaking beyond a threshold contractility that depends on the resistance of extracellular medium. In highly viscous environments, we predict bistability under moderate contractility, so that symmetry breaking needs to be activated. In a viscoelastic environment, we find periodic oscillations in cortex density and velocity polarization. At the boundary between viscous and viscoelastic environments, the cell may either cross into the viscoelastic medium, bounce back into the viscous medium, or become trapped at the boundary. The different scenarios defined different phase diagram that are confirmed by numerical simulations."

However, most existing structure-based pre-trained models primarily focus on the residue level, i.e., alpha carbon atoms, while ignoring other atoms like side chain atoms. We argue that modeling proteins at both residue and atom levels is important since the side chain atoms can also be crucial for numerous downstream tasks, for example, molecular docking. Nevertheless, we find that naively combining residue and atom information during pre-training typically fails. We identify a key reason is the information leakage caused by the inclusion of atom structure in the input, which renders residue-level pre-training tasks trivial and results in insufficiently expressive residue representations. To address this issue, we introduce a span mask pre-training strategy on 3D protein chains to learn meaningful representations of both residues and atoms. This leads to a simple yet effective approach to learning protein representation suitable for diverse downstream tasks. Extensive experimental results on binding site prediction and function prediction tasks demonstrate our proposed pre-training approach significantly outperforms other methods.
